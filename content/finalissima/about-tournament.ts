      heading: "What Is Football Festival Qatar?",
      body: `<p>Football Festival Qatar 2026 is an international football celebration bringing together top national teams for a series of high-profile matches across Qatar. The centrepiece of the festival is the <strong>Finalissima</strong> — a showpiece encounter between the reigning champions of South America and Europe, contested under FIFA's intercontinental format.</p>
<p>Beyond the headline fixture, the festival programme includes friendly internationals that give fans the chance to watch world-class squads compete at three iconic venues. The event runs from 26 to 31 March 2026, making it a compact yet action-packed week of football in the Middle East.</p>
<p>For anyone who followed the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, this festival offers a chance to revisit the same world-class infrastructure — now hosting a fresh chapter of international football.</p>`,
    },
    {
      heading: "Tournament Format & What to Expect",
      body: `<p>The festival is structured around several match days spread across six days. The Finalissima itself is a single knockout encounter — one match, one winner, with the trophy decided on the night. Supporting fixtures follow a standard international friendly format.</p>
<p>Matches are distributed across three stadiums in different parts of Qatar:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Lusail Stadium</strong> in Lusail — the largest venue and confirmed host of the Finalissima</li>
  <li><strong>Ahmad bin Ali Stadium</strong> in Al Rayyan — set against Qatar's striking desert landscape</li>
  <li><strong>Jassim bin Hamad Stadium</strong> in Doha — a more intimate, city-centre ground</li>
</ul>
<p>Each match day typically features one or two fixtures, allowing fans to plan around specific sessions. Check the <a href="/schedule">schedule page</a> for the full day-by-day breakdown once confirmed.</p>`,
    },
    {
      heading: "History & Significance",
      body: `<p>The Finalissima traces its roots back to the Artemio Franchi Cup, first held in 1985. After a long hiatus, the format was revived in 2022 when Argentina faced Italy at Wembley. The concept is simple yet compelling: pit the best of one continent against the best of another in a winner-takes-all contest.</p>
<p>Football Festival Qatar 2026 builds on this tradition by wrapping the Finalissima inside a broader programme of international matches. By staging the event in Qatar — a country that invested heavily in football infrastructure for the World Cup — organisers can offer fans a modern, well-connected experience across multiple venues.</p>
<p>The festival format also gives participating federations valuable preparation time ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, adding genuine sporting stakes beyond the trophy itself.</p>`,
    },
    {
      heading: "Practical Overview",
      body: `<p>The festival takes place from <strong>26 to 31 March 2026</strong> across three venues in Qatar. Lusail and Doha are connected by an efficient metro network, while Al Rayyan is accessible via the Green Line. Fans staying in central Doha can reach all three grounds within 30–45 minutes using public transport.</p>
<p>Qatar offers visa-free or visa-on-arrival entry for nationals of many countries — check your eligibility before booking travel. March temperatures typically range from 22°C to 30°C, making it a comfortable time to visit. For detailed transport advice and stadium-specific tips, see the <a href="/venue">venue guide</a>.</p>
<p>If you're planning to attend, the festival's compact schedule means you can realistically see multiple matches within a short trip.</p>`,
