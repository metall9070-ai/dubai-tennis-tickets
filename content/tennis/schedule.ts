      body: `<p>Each ticket covers one session (typically one match on centre court plus supporting matches). Here is how most fans plan their visit:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Finals only:</strong> Feb 21 (WTA Final) or Feb 28 (ATP Final) — the highest intensity, highest demand sessions. Book early.</li>
  <li><strong>Quarterfinals / Semifinals:</strong> Feb 19–20 (WTA) or Feb 26–27 (ATP) — top players guaranteed, better seat availability than finals.</li>
  <li><strong>Early rounds:</strong> Feb 15–18 (WTA) or Feb 23–25 (ATP) — most affordable, multiple matches per session, good for casual fans.</li>
  <li><strong>Multi-day trips:</strong> Attending both WTA and ATP events gives a complete experience across two weekends.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check individual session pages for current availability and pricing across Courtside, Prime, and Grandstand categories.</p>`,
