      body: `
<p>Lusail Stadium's bowl design provides continuous, uninterrupted views of the pitch from every section. The seating is divided across <strong>two main tiers</strong> (lower and upper), with a premium middle section in some areas.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lower Tier (Rows close to pitch)</strong> — The lower bowl wraps around the entire pitch, offering the closest views of the action. Midfield sections in the lower tier are typically Category 1, while corner and behind-goal sections are Category 2.</li>
<li><strong>Middle Tier</strong> — Elevated sections between the lower and upper bowls, offering a slightly raised perspective. These sections provide an excellent balance of proximity and overview.</li>
<li><strong>Upper Tier</strong> — The highest sections of the stadium, providing a panoramic, bird's-eye view of the entire pitch. Category 3 tickets are typically located here. While further from the pitch, the elevated angle gives fans a comprehensive view of team formations and tactical play.</li>
</ul>
<p>The stadium is a <strong>fully enclosed bowl</strong> with a retractable roof that can be closed to provide air-conditioned comfort. Even in open-roof configuration, the architectural design provides shade to a large portion of the seating areas.</p>
<p>All seating is <strong>individual, cushioned seats</strong> with cup holders. The stadium features wide concourses with food courts, beverage stands, merchandise shops, prayer rooms, and medical facilities on every level.</p>

      body: `
<p>To make the most of your Finalissima experience at Lusail Stadium, keep these tips in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arrive early</strong> — Gates typically open 2-3 hours before kickoff. Arriving early lets you avoid entry queues, explore the concourse, and soak in the pre-match atmosphere.</li>
<li><strong>Stay hydrated</strong> — Qatar in late March is warm. Drink plenty of water before and during the match. Water stations are available throughout the stadium.</li>
<li><strong>Dress code</strong> — Casual, comfortable clothing is appropriate. Football shirts and scarves are welcome. Qatar's public dress code is relatively relaxed at sporting events, though modesty is appreciated.</li>
<li><strong>Prohibited items</strong> — Large bags, professional cameras, drones, and outside food/beverages are typically not permitted. Check the event-specific regulations closer to match day.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile tickets</strong> — Ensure your phone is fully charged. Bring a portable charger as backup if your tickets are on your mobile device.</li>
<li><strong>Currency</strong> — Qatar uses the Qatari Riyal (QAR). Most vendors at the stadium accept credit cards and contactless payments.</li>
</ul>
