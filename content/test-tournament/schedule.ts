<p>The <strong>Finalissima 2026</strong> is a single-match event scheduled for <strong>Friday, 27 March 2026</strong> at <strong>Lusail Stadium</strong> in Lusail, Qatar. The match brings together the Copa America champions, Argentina, and the European Championship holders, Spain.</p>
<p>The exact kickoff time will be confirmed by the organizers closer to the match date. Evening kickoffs (typically 20:00 or 21:00 local time, AST/UTC+3) are standard for major international fixtures at Lusail Stadium, taking advantage of cooler temperatures and the stadium's spectacular lighting.</p>
<p>Gates typically open <strong>two to three hours before kickoff</strong>, giving fans time to explore the stadium concourse, enjoy pre-match entertainment, and settle into their seats before the teams emerge for warm-ups.</p>

      heading: "Session Details",
      body: `
<p>Unlike multi-day tournaments, the Finalissima is a <strong>one-off fixture</strong> — a single 90-minute match (plus any extra time and penalties if required). This format makes it a uniquely intense occasion: everything is decided in one evening.</p>
<p>The match follows standard FIFA international match regulations. If the scores are level after 90 minutes, the contest proceeds to extra time (two periods of 15 minutes each). If still level, a penalty shootout determines the winner.</p>
<p>There is <strong>one session only</strong>. All ticket categories provide access to the full match, including any extra time and penalty shootout. There are no separate tickets for different halves or periods.</p>

      body: `
<p>For fans travelling to Qatar for the Finalissima, here are key planning points:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flights</strong> — Hamad International Airport (DOH) in Doha is the primary entry point. The airport is approximately 35 km from Lusail Stadium, with journey times of 30-45 minutes by taxi or ride-share.</li>
<li><strong>Accommodation</strong> — Doha and Lusail offer a wide range of hotels from luxury resorts to mid-range options. Booking early is recommended as rooms fill quickly for major international fixtures.</li>
<li><strong>Transport to Stadium</strong> — The Lusail Metro station (Red Line North) provides direct access to the stadium area. Dedicated shuttle buses and taxi services also operate on match days.</li>
<li><strong>Visa</strong> — Qatar offers visa-on-arrival or e-visa options for many nationalities. Check current requirements for your country before travelling.</li>
</ul>
<p>We recommend arriving in Doha at least one day before the match to settle in and explore the city. The <a href="/venue">venue guide</a> has more detail on getting to and around Lusail Stadium.</p>
