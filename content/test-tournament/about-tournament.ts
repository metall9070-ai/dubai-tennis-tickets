<p>The <strong>Finalissima</strong> is the intercontinental championship of national football teams, contested between the winners of the <strong>Copa America</strong> (CONMEBOL) and the <strong>UEFA European Championship</strong>. It is the only competitive fixture that pits the best of South America against the best of Europe in a single, decisive match.</p>
<p>Originally established as the <strong>Artemio Franchi Cup</strong> in 1985, the competition was named after the late UEFA president who championed the idea of an intercontinental showdown between confederations. After two editions in 1985 and 1993, the format was dormant for nearly three decades before being revived as the Finalissima in 2022.</p>
<p>The 2026 edition brings together <strong>Argentina</strong>, winners of the Copa America 2024, and <strong>Spain</strong>, holders of UEFA Euro 2024. The match takes place on <strong>27 March 2026</strong> at <strong>Lusail Stadium in Qatar</strong>.</p>

<p>The intercontinental championship has a rich, if intermittent, history:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1985 — France vs Uruguay</strong> — The inaugural Artemio Franchi Cup was played over two legs. France, the 1984 European Champions, defeated Uruguay (Copa America 1983 winners) on penalties after the aggregate score finished level.</li>
<li><strong>1993 — Argentina vs Denmark</strong> — Argentina (Copa America 1991) beat Denmark (Euro 1992) 5-4 on penalties in Mar del Plata after a 1-1 draw in regular time.</li>
<li><strong>2022 — Argentina vs Italy</strong> — The revived competition, now branded as the Finalissima, saw Argentina (Copa America 2021) defeat Italy (Euro 2020) 3-0 at Wembley Stadium in London. Goals from Lautaro Martinez, Angel Di Maria, and Paulo Dybala secured a commanding win for La Albiceleste.</li>
</ul>
<p>Argentina have a strong pedigree in this competition, having won both editions they have participated in. The 2026 Finalissima gives them the chance to extend that record against a formidable Spanish side.</p>

      heading: "Competition Format",
      body: `
<p>The Finalissima is a <strong>single-match event</strong>. There are no group stages, no semi-finals, and no return legs — just one 90-minute fixture between two continental champions on neutral ground.</p>
<p>If the match is level after 90 minutes, it proceeds directly to <strong>extra time</strong> (two 15-minute periods). If the scores remain tied, the winner is determined by a <strong>penalty shootout</strong>. The format ensures that one team walks away with the trophy at the end of the evening.</p>
<p>The match is played under <strong>FIFA international match regulations</strong>, with each team permitted five substitutions (using three windows, plus the half-time interval). VAR technology is used for all major decisions.</p>
<p>This one-off format creates a unique atmosphere — every moment matters, and the stakes are absolute. For fans, it delivers 90-plus minutes of high-intensity football without the dilution of a multi-match tournament.</p>

<p>Argentina enter the 2026 Finalissima as one of the most successful national teams in recent football history. Their victory at the <strong>2024 Copa America</strong> added to a remarkable trophy haul that includes the <strong>2022 FIFA World Cup</strong> and the <strong>2021 Copa America</strong>.</p>
<p>Known as <strong>La Albiceleste</strong>, Argentina's style blends South American flair with tactical discipline. Their squad features players from Europe's top leagues, combining experience at the highest level with the passion and intensity that Argentine football is celebrated for worldwide.</p>
<p>Having already won the 2022 Finalissima against Italy, Argentina will be looking to defend their intercontinental title and further cement their status as the dominant force in international football.</p>

<p>Spain arrive in Lusail as <strong>European Champions</strong>, having won UEFA Euro 2024 with a style of play that continued the country's tradition of technical, possession-based football.</p>
<p><strong>La Roja</strong> have been one of the defining forces in international football over the past two decades. Their golden era — Euro 2008, World Cup 2010, and Euro 2012 — redefined how international football is played. The Euro 2024 victory confirmed that a new generation has picked up the mantle.</p>
<p>With a squad built around quick combinations, positional intelligence, and clinical finishing, Spain present a genuine challenge to Argentina's intercontinental reign. The Finalissima offers them a chance to add a unique trophy to their collection and prove they are the best national team on the planet.</p>
